### _Under development_<br/>
The project is under development right now and may not run on all machines.
### Steps to run<br/>
* After cloning this project, put a photo of your face **clearly visible** in the `.resources/prefaces` folder. The `.resources` folder is hidden so you may have to enable view hidden folders option.<br/><br/>
* Initiate a virtual environment in the project directory, or just execute it globally if you're a daredevil.<br/><br/>
* Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` using a terminal in the project directory to install all the dependencies. This may take some time.<br/><br/>
* For Windows users, you need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (not VS Code) manually to run the project.</br></br>
After all the dependencies are successfully installed, run the main python file `python3 main.py`
